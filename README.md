# Abstract
Near-Earth asteroids can potentially be hazardous. In this project, the orbit of asteroid 2002 TX68 was observed over the span of four weeks using a 12’’ LX 200 Meade telescope. Orbital elements were determined from the data gathered by finding the position and velocity vectors of 2002 TX68 using the Method of Gauss. The resulting orbital elements are: e = 0.4314 ± 0.0887, a = 2.1740 ± 0.3490, i = is 11.1750◦± 1.0787, Ω = 60.7462◦± 7.2617, and ω= 146.81997◦± 1.514. These orbital elements allowed for the creation of a model of the orbit of 2002 TX68 as well as the integration of the orbit forward 300,000 years using the python package REBOUND.  In addition, the CHIRON spectrometer of the SMARTS telescope consortium was employed on 2002 TX68 to find the mean apparent magnitude of the asteroid at different wavelengths. The magnitude-wavelength slope was used to determine that 2002 TX68 is a blue C-type asteroid. Using this information and density information for C-type asteroids, order of magnitude calculations for the size of 2002 TX68, as well as the kinetic energy that would be released if 2002 TX68 were to hit the Earth, were conducted. It was found that 2002 TX68’s closest approach to the Earth will be 0.05488 AU away. As this is much farther away from the Earth than the moon, which is located 0.00257 AU from the Earth, this study discovered that 2002 TX68 is not likely to pose a significant threat to Earth.
